# Sorrel Finance

Introducing the first lending platform designed to channel funding into the education industry through Open Campus & EDU Chain. Users can provide collateral in EDU coins and take out loans in USDS (USD Sorrel), which is minted on the platform. Before taking out a loan, users are able to estimate the amount of EDU coins that they will have to provide as a collateral.
The project later aims to expand to offer additional functionality such as USDS price control strategies in order for it to remained pegged to USD at all times.
